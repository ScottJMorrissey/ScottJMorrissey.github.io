	<h1>Hi there, I'm Scott Morrissey!</h1>
	<p>Scott Morrissey (BSc Hons - Class 1) is a PhD Candidate at James Cook University, Townsville, Australia. He has an interest in cnidarians and is currently developing and applying new techniques to better understand the ecology of dangerous jellyfish. He is also interested in the broader application of environmental DNA techniques in ecology and other industries such as aquaculture. 
		Scott graduated with a BSc Honours in 2018 from JCU where he examined the use of age-structured statolith chemistry profiles to elucidate the movement histories of Cubozoan jellyfish. Through doing so, he revealed a relationship between statolith elemental strontium (Sr) and temperature, independent of salinity. He further applied the validated relationship to test a paradigm surrounding the movements of a Hawaiian Irukandji jellyfish into deep waters which he subsequently confirmed as true. 
		He is now undertaking his PhD at JCU where he is investigating and utilising a forensic genetic approach (environmental DNA) to detect different life history stages of deadly box jellyfish and is testing the techniques use as an ecological tool to further understand their ecology.</a></p>
